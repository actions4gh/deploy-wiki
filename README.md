### Inputs

- **`server-url`:** The URL of the server. Usually `https://github.com`, but can
  be changed if you're using cross-instances. Defaults to the
  `github.server_url`.

- **`repository`:** The `user/repo` slug of the repository. Defaults to
  `github.repository` which is usually what you want. This is the repo from
  which the `https://github.com/${repo}/wiki` tab will be downloaded from.

- **`token`:** The authentication token. You don't need this unless you're
  pulling from a different repository that's private and needs a token.

- **`path`:** The specified path. This is where the wiki will be downloaded to.
  Defaults to `.` which is the current directory. You might want to make this
  `wiki` or some other subfolder.

- **`delete`:** Whether or not to delete files that are in the destination (the
  `path` input) but aren't present in the wiki. This is useful for syncing a
  wiki to a local folder. Default is `true`.

## Outputs

- **`wiki-git-url`:** The URL of the wiki's [Gollum] Git repository. Use this if
  you need to do anything else with said Git repository. Usually it's something
  like `https://github.com/user/repo.wiki.git`.
